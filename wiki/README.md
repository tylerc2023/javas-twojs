## Overview
#### Focus on Vector Shapes
Two.js is deeply inspired by flat [motion graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_graphics). As a result, two.js aims to make the creation and animation of flat shapes easier and more concise.

#### Scenegraph
At its core two.js relies on a [scenegraph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph). This means that when you draw or create an object (a Two.Path or Two.Group), two actually stores and remembers that. After you make the object you can apply any number of operations to it â€” e.g: rotation, translation, scale, etc..

#### Animation Loop
Two.js has a built in animation loop. It is simple in nature and can be automated or paired with another animation library. For more information check out the [examples](../examples).

#### SVG Interpreter
Two.js features a [Scalable Vector Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) Interpreter. This means developers and designers alike can create SVG elements in commercial applications like [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator) and bring them into your two.js scene. For more information check out the [examples](../examples).
