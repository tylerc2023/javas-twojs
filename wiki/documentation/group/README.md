# Two.Group


__Extends__: `Two.Shape`


This is a container object for two.js â€” it can hold shapes as well as other groups. At a technical level it can be considered an empty transformation matrix. It is recommended to use `two.makeGroup()` in order to add groups to your instance of two, but it's not necessary. Unless specified methods return their instance of `Two.Group` for the purpose of chaining.

## Two.Group#cap


















---

## Two.Group#join


















---

## Two.Group#miter
