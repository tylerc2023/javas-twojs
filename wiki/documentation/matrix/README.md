# Two.Matrix



A class to store 3 x 3 transformation matrix information. In addition to storing data `Two.Matrix` has suped up methods for commonplace mathematical operations.

## Two.Matrix.manual








Determines whether Two.js automatically calculates the values for the matrix or if the developer intends to manage the matrix.









::: tip nota-bene
- Setting to `true` nullifies [Two.Shape.translation](/documentation/shape#two-shape-translation), [Two.Shape.rotation](/documentation/shape#two-shape-rotation), and [Two.Shape.scale](/documentation/shape#two-shape-scale).
