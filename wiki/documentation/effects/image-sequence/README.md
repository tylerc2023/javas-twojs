+ `Two.Texture`









Shorthand function to prepare source image material into readable format by [Two.ImageSequence](/documentation/imagesequence).



| Argument | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `textureOrString` | The texture or string to create a [Two.Texture](/documentation/texture) from. |

## Two.ImageSequence.play








| Argument | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `firstFrame` | The index of the frame to start the animation with. |
